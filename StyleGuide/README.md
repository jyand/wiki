# Style Guide
This is not meant to be authoritative. There may be some points about efficiency but mostly these are my opinions about what looks good in terms of readability.

* 8-space tabs
* 1TB curly-brace style
* space before a semicolon (I've never seen anyone else do this but I think it looks better)
* Many like to limit columns to 80, but I have no problem with unbounded width. One's text editor should display line numbers and wrap lines.
* Avoid extensive, and especially unnecessary, commenting. Naming conventions and general readability should be communicative.
* When the intended effect is the same (which is most of the time), pre-increment rather than post-icrement.
* Avoid the elseif keyword. Depending on the situation, a switch statement or additional if statements may be appropriate.
* An empty loop body should have both curly-braces on the same line as it's invocation.
